```AS A marketing agency

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Horiseon Website

This is the final images of the website with the amendments I made. I had refactored some header tags for example in the footer from h3 to h4. I also had to add some alt tags to the images which is important because it makes the website more accessible. I also added some comments to label different sections of the website to make the code more easier to read.
